    "## 1. Team Formation and Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team consists of four members with complementary strengths. Below are our self-identified skills and anticipated contributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**• Roy Phelps**  \n",
    "Skills: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, basic data cleaning, visualization  \n",
    "Contribution: Code development, documentation, Git/GitHub organization\n",
    "\n",
    "**• Shad Scarboro**  \n",
    "Skills: Data sourcing, research, presentation formatting  \n",
    "Contribution: Lead on data acquisition planning and writeup support\n",
    "\n",
    "**• Leland Weeks**  \n",
    "Skills: Python scripting, exploratory analysis, math/stats foundations  \n",
    "Contribution: Support on initial dataset exploration and preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "**• Evan Wessel**  \n",
    "Skills: Writing, data summaries, editing  \n",
    "Contribution: Drafting sections of the proposal and summarizing findings\n",
    "\n",
    "As a team, we will collaborate across tasks but take responsibility in these areas to ensure efficiency and clarity.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Source of Interest (To Be Finalized)\n",
    "\n",
    "We are in the process of selecting a dataset topic. The dataset will be chosen based on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real-world relevance and potential impact  \n",
    "- Feasibility of acquisition within the course timeline  \n",
    "- Opportunities for exploratory analysis and coding  \n",
    "- Clear connection to potential users or applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential areas we are considering:**  \n",
    "- Health & wellness data  \n",
    "- Environmental or climate data  \n",
    "- Sports statistics  \n",
    "- Social media or public sentiment  \n",
    "- Education and academic performance  \n",
    "- Transportation or mobility data\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we finalize a topic, we will specify:  \n",
    "- The exact source (API, website, files, etc.)  \n",
    "- The expected format (CSV, JSON, text, etc.)  \n",
    "- The licensing or access constraints, if any\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Potential Users and Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "We intend to collect a dataset that can be useful beyond this class. Once our topic is chosen, we will identify:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Who might use this data (e.g., researchers, policy analysts, educators, businesses, developers)  \n",
    "- Example use cases (e.g., modeling, dashboards, comparison studies, predictive insights)  \n",
    "- Academic or commercial relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will be updated to reflect the chosen dataset and audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Plan for Acquiring the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Our plan will depend on the chosen topic, but we anticipate one of the following acquisition methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Downloading CSV/JSON files from open data portals or repositories  \n",
    "- Using a public API and writing Python scripts to fetch the data  \n",
    "- Web scraping (if allowed and ethical)  \n",
    "- Combining multiple smaller datasets into a single structured source\n",
    "\n",
    "After finalizing the dataset, we will document:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tools we plan to use (e.g., Python, BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas)  \n",
    "- Steps to handle cleaning and preprocessing  \n",
    "- Any potential obstacles (e.g., limits, formatting issues, permissions)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Sample of the Dataset (Placeholder)\n",
    "\n",
    "A preliminary data sample will be included once our source is selected. This may include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A few sample rows  \n",
    "- A screenshot, snippet, or small extracted file  \n",
    "- A short block of test code if we access via API or scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Example placeholder until the dataset is confirmed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Sample data will be inserted here once the source is chosen.]\n",
    "Possible formats: CSV snippet, JSON object, or scraped output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Submission Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "We will submit the proposal as a Markdown or PDF document (or via Jupyter Notebook if preferred) including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All required sections  \n",
    "- Team member names and roles  \n",
    "- Dataset description and acquisition plan  \n",
    "- Sample or preview of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our topic is locked in, we will revise this template and finalize the language.\n"
