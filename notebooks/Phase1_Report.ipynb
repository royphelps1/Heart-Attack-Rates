    "## 1) Proposed Dataset of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to construct a dataset that would enable a thorough analysis cardiovascular health and lifestyle score across nations. We expect to aggregate information from many government and private healthcare datasets resulting in a singular dataset representing many demographics (e.g., age, gender, air pollution exposure), health vitals (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes) and activities (e.g., smoking, diet, physical activity). The data will most likely need to be collected via several access methods (e.g., direct download, open and protected APIs) and formats (e.g. CSV, relational database, unstructred data). We plan to present the final dataset as a CSV to minimize ingestion friction and maximize simplicity and readability. \n",
