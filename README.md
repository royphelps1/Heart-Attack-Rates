# DSCI-511 Project – Heart Attack Risk in China

## Phase 1 Dataset & Documentation

This repository contains the project work for **DSCI-511: Data Acquisition and Pre-Processing**.  
Phase 1 focused on scoping, cleaning, and enriching a heart-attack dataset related to China.

### Phase 1 Inputs:
- **Dataset:** `data/raw/heart_attack_china.csv`
- **Data Dictionary:** `docs/data_dictionary.md`
- **Normalized Variables Plan:** `docs/normalized_flags.md`
- **Phase 1 Report Scaffold:** `docs/Phase1_Report_Scaffold.md`

### Phase 1 Output:
- `data/processed/heart_attack_china_enriched.csv`

### Phase 1 Work Includes:
- Initial data cleaning and normalization
- Creating derived flags (e.g., SBP missing, hypertension thresholds)
- Standardizing gender categories
- Building baseline cardiovascular risk attributes
- File-level documentation and schematics

---

## Phase 2 – WHO Integration, Merging, and Spatial Analysis

Phase 2 extended the dataset through World Health Organization (WHO) indicators and geospatial context to enable **province-level analysis**.

### Key Phase 2 Inputs:
- Phase 1 enriched dataset:
  - `data/processed/heart_attack_china_enriched.csv`
- WHO indicators (mean SBP by province and sex)
- China boundary dataset (Kaggle / GADM):
  - `data/external/gadm36_CHN_1.json`

### Custom Dataset Built in Phase 2:
- `data/processed/urban_or_rural_centroids.geojson`

This dataset was programmatically created and includes:
- Province name
- Urban vs Rural classification
- Longitude / Latitude centroids

Centroids generated from:
- Wikipedia province and capital data
- OpenStreetMap geocoding via OSMnx

## Main Notebook

**Phase 2 Implementation Notebook:**
notebooks/phase2_all_in_notebook.ipynb

This notebook performs:

- WHO dataset cleaning and latest-year selection
- Integration of WHO indicators into the heart-attack dataset
- Creation of versioned datasets:
  - `heart_attack_china_analysis_ready.csv`
  - `heart_attack_china_model_ready.csv`
  - `heart_attack_china_with_who_latest_by_sex.csv`
- Aggregation from patient-level → province-level metrics:
  - `heart_attack_rate`
  - `mean_sbp`
  - `mean_cvd_risk`
- Construction of GeoDataFrames via GeoPandas
- Choropleth maps of:
  - Heart attack rate by province
  - Mean systolic blood pressure by province
- Visualization overlays using **contextily** (OpenStreetMap)
- Urban/rural centroid visualization with province labeling
- Reproducible GeoJSON workflows

---

## Figures and Maps

All maps and figures generated by the notebook are saved locally to:

reports/figures/


Examples:
- `heart_attack_rate_by_province.png`
- `mean_sbp_by_province.png`
- `heart_attack_rate_with_basemap.png`
- `mean_sbp_with_basemap.png`
- `urban_rural_centroids_with_labels.png`



---

## Large File Handling

A large patient-level GeoJSON file may be generated:

data/processed/china_heart_attack_analysis.geojson (~760MB)

This file is:
- Excluded from Git via `gitignore`
- Regeneraged automaticaly from the notebook
- Indended only for visualization aand spatial exploration

---

## Reproducibility the Notebook
notebooks/phase2_all_in_notebook.ipynb

2. Run the notebook from top to bottom.
3. Outputs will be written automatically to:

data/processed/
reports/figures/

# Project References & Data Sources

This project integrates medical data, geographic reference data, and programmatically generated spatial data to support analysis and visualization.

---

## 1. Heart Attack China Dataset
**Source:** Kaggle  
**Description:**  
Dataset containing provincial-level heart attack indicators and related health factors across China, including urban vs rural classification.

Used for:
- Primary analysis
- Risk-factor exploration
- Aggregations and statistical analysis

Original source credited on Kaggle.

---

## 2. China Province Boundaries (GADM v3.6)
**Source:** Kaggle (GADM Database of Global Administrative Areas)  
**File:** `gadm36_CHN_1.json`  

**Description:**  
This dataset provides official geographic boundaries for China’s first-level administrative divisions (provinces). The dataset was used strictly for visualization and spatial context.

Used for:
- Background map layer
- Geographic reference when plotting centroids

Reference:
https://gadm.org

---

## 3. Wikipedia – Administrative Divisions
**Source:** Wikipedia  

Used to extract province and capital information:

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| *Provinces of China* | Province names and largest cities |
| *Autonomous regions of China* | Autonomous regions and capitals |
| *Direct-administered municipalities* | Municipalities and capital cities |

Data accessed via Wikipedia REST API and parsed programmatically.

---

## 4. OpenStreetMap / OSMnx
**Source:** OpenStreetMap via Python OSMnx library  
**Library:** `osmnx`  

**Description:**  
Used to geocode province names and capitals and extract centroid coordinates for:

- Rural province centers  
- Urban city centers  

Used for:
- Generating custom GeoJSON centroid dataset  
- Latitude/Longitude calculations  

Website:
https://www.openstreetmap.org  
Library documentation:
https://osmnx.readthedocs.io

---

## 5. Custom Spatial Dataset (This Project)
