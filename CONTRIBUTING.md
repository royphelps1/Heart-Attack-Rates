# Contributing Guide

## Project Workflow

This project used a simple, lightweight workflow appropriate for a small course team:

- All work was completed directly on the **`main`** branch.
- The project contains **two primary notebooks**:

**Phase 1 Notebook (Data Cleaning & Enrichment):**

notebooks/phase1_preprocessing.ipynb


**Phase 2 Notebook (WHO Integration, Air Quality, Spatial Analysis):**

notebooks/phase2_all_in_notebook.ipynb


- Notebook markdown explanations
- Data-cleaning and feature-engineering steps
- WHO integration logic
- Air-quality merging logic
- Spatial analysis and mapping code
- README and documentation

There was **no branching model**, **no PR workflow**, and **no LaTeX report** used in this project.

## Editing the Notebooks

Guidelines for contributing to Phase 1 and Phase 2 notebooks:

1. Make small, clear edits to code blocks or markdown text.
2. Keep markdown explanations clean, consistent, and easy to follow.
3. Ensure both notebooks remain fully reproducible when run top-to-bottom.
4. Avoid committing extremely large output cells.
5. All generated figures (from Phase 2) should be saved automatically to:

reports/figures/

## Data Handling

Project data is stored under the `data/` directory:

data/
raw/ # Original datasets (heart attack, WHO)
processed/ # Outputs generated by the notebooks
external/ # Geographic boundary files (e.g., GADM)


Important notes:

- Large files (such as the ~760MB GeoJSON) are **ignored via `.gitignore`**.
- Only small reference files are committed.
- All processed outputs for Phase 1 and Phase 2 can be recreated by running the corresponding notebooks.

---

## Documentation

Documentation files are located in:

docs/


This includes:

- Data dictionary  
- Normalized variable definitions  
- Phase 1 documentation scaffolds  

README and notebook markdown were updated collaboratively to keep the project description aligned with the final workflow.

## Figures and Outputs (Phase 2)

All Phase 2 visualizations are saved to:

reports/figures/


These include:

- Choropleth maps  
- Basemap overlays  
- Urban/rural centroid maps  

Figures should not be added manually—only generated through the notebook.

---

## No Branching or LaTeX

Although placeholders exist in the folder structure:

- **No branching model** (e.g., `dev`, feature branches) was used.  
- **No LaTeX paper** was produced for this phase.  
- All work was coordinated directly through edits to Phase 1 and Phase 2 notebooks and documentation.

---

## Summary

This Contributing Guide reflects the actual workflow used by the project team:

- Direct commits to `main`  
- Two central notebooks (Phase 1 and Phase 2) driving the entire pipeline  
- Clear and aligned documentation  
- Fully reproducible outputs  
- Minimal workflow overhead  

Ideal for a collaborative academic project and clear for future contributors.
