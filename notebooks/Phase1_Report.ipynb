    "\n",
    "## 1) Proposed Dataset of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to construct a dataset that would enable a thorough analysis cardiovascular health and lifestyle score across nations. We expect to aggregate information from many government and private healthcare datasets resulting in a singular dataset representing many demographics (e.g., age, gender, air pollution exposure), health vitals (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes) and activities (e.g., smoking, diet, physical activity). The data will most likely need to be collected via several access methods (e.g., direct download, open and protected APIs) and formats (e.g. CSV, relational database, unstructred data). We plan to present the final dataset as a CSV to minimize ingestion friction and maximize simplicity and readability. \n",

    "## 3) Potential Users and Applications\n",
    "**Users:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying cardiovascular health is critical for understanding disease risk and developing effective treatments, so the potential users of the dataset include hospitals, cardiology departments, public health analysts, professors, and students.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications for this dataset include developing predictive models for risk assessment and/or improving existing models. The dataset can assist with early diagnosis and treatment methods. It can also assist health care workers and patients understand the risk factors and to tailor recommendations for lifestyle changes. o"

    "## 7) Limitations & Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, we recognize the following limitations based on the current dataset and Phase 1 scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No time dimension**: The dataset does not include dates for patient records or events.\n",
    "- **Geographic standardization**: The region/province fields exist but may require normalization if we plan external joins or enrichment.\n",
    "- **Missingness or imbalance**: Some attributes may contain null values or skewed distributions (to be profiled further in Phase 2).\n",
    "- **No official data dictionary from the source**: We created our own in `../docs/data_dictionary.md` based on column names and inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planned Improvements (Phase 2 or later in Phase 1):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a `record_date` field (either synthetic or real if found in updated versions).\n",
    "- Use the upcoming `normalized_flags.md` file to capture features such as hypertension, diabetes, lifestyle risk, etc.\n",
    "- Validate and standardize geographic categories for potential joins with external datasets.\n",
    "- Explore optional enrichment from public health and demographic sources (e.g., WHO, NHANES, socioeconomic indicators).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Regional health indicators**  \n",

    "- **Environmental factors**  \n",
